## Liquidity Measurement Framework

---

### Core Liquidity Metrics

<details>
<summary>Multi-Dimensional Liquidity Measurement Techniques</summary>

---

- **Spread Analysis**:
  - Measures the difference between the highest bid and lowest ask prices.
  - **Formula**: `Spread = Ask_Price - Bid_Price` or `Relative Spread = (Ask_Price - Bid_Price) / Mid_Price`.
  - Indicates transaction cost and market tightness; narrower spreads (`<0.1%`) reflect high liquidity.
  - Example: Spread of `0.08%` (`$32` at BTC price `$40,000`) on Binance for BTC/USDT.

- **Market Depth**:
  - Quantifies total order volume within a specified price range (`±1%`, `±2%` from mid-price).
  - **Formula**: `Depth = Σ(Volume_Bid within ±x%) + Σ(Volume_Ask within ±x%)`.
  - High depth (e.g., `$25M` at `±1%`) ensures large orders execute with minimal price impact.
  - Example: Depth of `$25M` for BTC/USDT (`$15M` bid, `$10M` ask).

- **Liquidity Resilience**:
  - Measures the speed of spread and depth recovery after large trades.
  - **Formula**: `Resilience = Time to Recover Spread to Pre-Trade Level`.
  - High resilience (e.g., `<10` seconds) indicates robust market recovery.
  - Example: Spread recovers in `8` seconds after a `$2M` trade on ETH/USDT.

- **Immediacy**:
  - Assesses the ability to execute trades instantly with minimal cost.
  - **Formula**: `Immediacy = 1 / (Execution Time + Slippage)`.
  - High immediacy reduces slippage for time-sensitive trades.
  - Example: Immediacy score of `0.95` for BTC/USDT with `<1` second execution.

#### Transaction Cost Analysis

- **Slippage**:
  - Difference between expected and actual execution price.
  - **Formula**: `Slippage (%) = (Actual_Price - Expected_Price) / Expected_Price * 100`.
  - Example: A `$1M` buy order for ETH at `$2500` executes at `$2525`, slippage = `1%`.
- **Market Impact**:
  - Price change caused by a large trade.
  - **Formula**: `Market Impact = (Post-Trade Mid_Price - Pre-Trade Mid_Price) / Pre-Trade Mid_Price`.
  - Example: A `$2M` trade shifts BTC/USDT price by `0.3%`.

#### Example Data Table: Liquidity Metrics for BTC/USDT (Binance, Dec 2024)

| **Metric**          | **Value**         | **Description**                              |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Spread**          | `0.08%` (`$32`)   | Average bid-ask spread at `$40,000` BTC price |
| **Depth (±1%)**     | `$25M`            | `$15M` bid, `$10M` ask                      |
| **Slippage**        | `0.5%`            | For `$1M` order in normal conditions         |
| **Resilience**      | `8` seconds       | Time to recover spread after `$2M` trade     |
| **Immediacy**       | `0.95`            | Score based on execution time and slippage   |

- **Key Message**: Multi-dimensional liquidity metrics provide a holistic view of market quality, enabling precise monitoring and optimization of trading conditions.

## Market Maker Performance Evaluation

---

### Performance Metrics and Comparative Analysis

<details>
<summary>Tracking and Benchmarking Market Maker Efficiency</summary>

---

- **Fill Rate**:
  - Ratio of filled orders to total quoted volume.
  - **Formula**: `Fill Rate = (Filled Volume / Total Quoted Volume) * 100`.
  - High fill rate (`>80%`) indicates effective liquidity provision.
  - Example: Wintermute achieves `85%` fill rate for BTC/USDT on Binance.

- **Inventory Turnover**:
  - Frequency of asset turnover in MM inventory.
  - **Formula**: `Inventory Turnover = Total Traded Volume / Average Inventory`.
  - High turnover (`>5` times/day) reduces inventory risk.
  - Example: Turnover of `6` times/day for `50` ETH inventory.

- **Risk-Adjusted Return**:
  - Profit adjusted for price volatility.
  - **Formula**: `Risk-Adjusted Return = PnL / Volatility of Inventory`.
  - Example: PnL of `$10,000` with volatility `5%` yields risk-adjusted return of `2%`.

- **Quote Coverage**:
  - Percentage of time MM maintains active bid/ask quotes.
  - **Formula**: `Quote Coverage = (Time with Active Quotes / Total Trading Time) * 100`.
  - Target: `>95%` coverage for continuous liquidity.
  - Example: `97%` coverage for ETH/USDT.

- **PnL (Profit and Loss)**:
  - Net profit from spread and trading fees.
  - **Formula**: `PnL = (Sell Volume * Ask Price - Buy Volume * Bid Price) + Trading Fees`.
  - Example: `$10,000` daily PnL for BTC/USDT with `0.08%` spread.

#### Comparative Benchmarking Table: MM Performance (Binance vs Coinbase, Dec 2024)

| **Metric**            | **Binance (Wintermute)** | **Coinbase (GSR)** | **Comparison**                     |

| **Fill Rate**         | `85%`                   | `80%`             | Binance outperforms by `5%`       |
| **Inventory Turnover**| `6` times/day           | `4` times/day     | Binance more efficient            |
| **PnL**               | `$10,000`/day          | `$7,500`/day      | Binance higher profitability       |
| **Quote Coverage**    | `97%`                  | `94%`             | Binance more consistent            |
| **Spread**            | `0.08%`                | `0.15%`           | Binance tighter spread            |

  - Example: Compares BTC/USDT spread on Binance (`0.08%`) vs Coinbase (`0.15%`).
- **Risk Adjustment**:
  - Adjusts performance metrics for volatility.
  - Example: `Risk-Adjusted PnL = PnL / (Volatility * Inventory Exposure)`.

#### Transformation Example: Spread Calculation

    ```python
    def calculate_spread(order_book):
        bid = max(order_book['bids'], key=lambda x: x['price'])
        ask = min(order_book['asks'], key=lambda x: x['price'])
        return ask['price'] - bid['price']
    ```

- **Key Message**: Sophisticated transformation logic ensures accurate and comparable liquidity metrics across diverse market conditions.

## Implementation Roadmap

---

### Phased Approach to Building Analytics System

<details>
<summary>Step-by-Step Implementation Plan</summary>

---

- **Phase 1 (1-3 Months)**:
  - Set up Kafka and Redis for real-time data collection.
  - Build core data tables (order book, execution, MM performance).
  - Compute basic metrics (spread, depth, slippage).
- **Phase 2 (4-6 Months)**:
  - Deploy React-based real-time dashboard with WebSocket integration.
  - Integrate Kaiko and CryptoQuant for benchmarking.
  - Implement alerts for spread `>0.5%`, slippage `>1%`.
- **Phase 3 (7-12 Months)**:
  - Optimize MM algorithms using machine learning.
  - Store historical data in Snowflake for trend analysis.
  - Deploy optimization strategies (e.g., spread reduction).
- **Phase 4 (12+ Months)**:
  - Integrate with trading and risk management systems.
  - Expand analytics to new trading pairs and exchanges.

### Liquidity and MM Performance Analysis for BTC/USDT

<details>
<summary>Detailed Analysis of BTC/USDT (Dec 2024)</summary>

---

- **Context**:
  - Trading Pair: BTC/USDT.
  - Market Maker: Wintermute.
  - Price: `$40,000`.
  - Data Source: Binance API.
- **Liquidity Metrics**:
  - **Spread**: `0.08%` (`$32`).
  - **Depth (±1%)**: `$25M` (`$15M` bid, `$10M` ask).
  - **Slippage**: `0.5%` for `$1M` order, `2%` in high volatility.
  - **Resilience**: Spread recovers in `8` seconds after `$2M` trade.
- **MM Performance**:
  - **Fill Rate**: `85%` (850/1000 orders filled).
  - **PnL**: `$10,000`/day from spread and fees.
  - **Inventory Turnover**: `6` times/day for `50` BTC inventory.
  - **Quote Coverage**: `97%`, ensuring consistent liquidity.
- **Market Research Insight**:
  - Binance outperforms Coinbase (`0.15%` spread, `$23M` depth).
  - High volume (`$36B`/day) drives tight spreads and deep markets.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Reduce spread to `<0.06%` to compete with top exchanges.
  - Increase depth to `>$30M` at `±1%` via additional MM partnerships.
  - Deploy slippage alerts for `>1%` to protect traders.
